### Project Overview

 The idea was to read important data from the files, manipulate the same and write again into the files.


### Learnings from the project

 Topics covered in this are as follows

- String operations
- Conditional statement and loops
- File I/O
- Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I just recalled the things that were covered in the previous sessions for python like functions, lambda, string and managing and working with files the concept hele me to solve the problem easily.


### Challenges faced

 Well reading thoroughly the problem statement and the instructions provided is the must. I used the wrong variable name in problem second and it affected me in succeeding problems
