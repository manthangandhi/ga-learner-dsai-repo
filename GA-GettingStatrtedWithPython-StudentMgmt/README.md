### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Reading the problem statement and the task is much crucial part, once you know the problem statement you can very well accomplish the task and find the solution for the same. 


### Challenges faced

 Well I missed few points while reading that were not respecting the test cases say for example I missed out declaring and defining a variable and the code was well but it didn't respect the test cases that throw me an issue. So as said above reading thoroughly the task and problem are most important.
